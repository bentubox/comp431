What did you hope to learn but did not?
	
	I didn't really come into the course with any specific things that I wanted to learn.

What did you really enjoy learning about?
	
	In general, I just wanted to gain a better understanding of industry-grade websites were put together, and I think this course really helped with that. The process of demystifying this subject was rewarding to me.

What worked well in the course? and how?
	
	The inclass assignments building into the homework assignments helped a lot of concepts click better, made them more memorable, and made ir easier to understand the reasoning behind the things we learned about.

What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
	
	Nothing really big. One of the things I struggled with personally was the sheer number of new technologies that we had to deal with in almost every single class. I often spent a lot of time troubleshooting these technologies without making progress on actual assignments.

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class
exercises, goals of projects â€“ and be specific please!

	Although you did a good job of helping the people who approached you with technology issues, I think the course would benefit from having more TAs (and more accessible TAs).

Anything else you like to say?
	
	Not really. Thanks for putting forth the effort to make this an informative and enriching course.
