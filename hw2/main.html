				<p>	The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
				they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts
				of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:
				the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on
				each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,
				with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the
				other.  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large
				dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice
				quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'
				she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed
				to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
				her, to pass away the time.</p>

				<p>	Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had
				read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that
				she knew the name of nearly everything there.  `That's the
				judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.<p>

				<p>	The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown
				over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
				did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly
				not becoming.</p>

				<p>	`And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve
				creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because
				some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they
				are the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three times over
				to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and
				rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the
				meaning of it at all.  However, `jury-men' would have done just
				as well.</p>

				<p>	I did some research to discover which herbs were especially
				beneficial to bees. These include aromatic herbs such as
				lavender, rosemary, thyme, sage, bee balm (bergamot), hyssop,
				anise-hyssop, basil and marjoram; wild herbs such as motherwort,
				catnip and purple loosestrife; bitter herbs such as southernwood,
				wormwood and rue; nectar rich herbs such as clover and alfalfa;
				all the mints; the borage family; and the rose family.
				I had already known that bees loved borage and I had planted it
				among my squashes, cucumbers and melons in order to attract bees
				for pollination. Now, I planted patches all over the garden,
				making good use of the plants that had self-seeded from the
				previous year.</p>

				<p>	I also carefully noted the blooming periods of all the herbs,
				flowers, weeds, and flowering shrubs and trees on our property.
				Over the next couple of years I planted additional varieties to
				assure that there was an uninterrupted and rich banquet of
				blossoms from the first crocuses in spring, all through the
				summer, to the crisp days of autumn when bees are immobilized by
				the cold and no longer able to work.</p>

				<p>	I also increased the size of my herb garden. Generally, I harvest
				my herbs just before they come into flower, or else I harvest the
				flowers themselves as soon as they open. I planted extras of each
				variety so that I could allow a number of plants to go to full
				flower and so supply the bees.</p>

				<p>	The rewards of this bit of extra effort have been enormous. The
				population of bees has continued to increase over the years. It
				is a pleasure to go out to the garden and hear my comfrey patch
				buzzing as the blossoms are visited by hoards of honey bees and
				bumble bees.</p>

				<p>	There may be more ancient horticultural pursuits than the art of 
				bonsai, but not many.  Bonsai is the technique of training trees to 
				grow in small pots, dwarfing and diminutizing them to create 
				miniature versions of nature.  And in so doing, technique is 
				transformed into art.  In the hands of a master, bonsai becomes great 
				art, timeless, subtly changing and evolving, weaving beauty with 
				reflective quality.  For bonsai is not merely a little tree.  It is 
				vision, the ability to see what could be, artistically translated 
				into a three-dimensional, four-season echo of the natural world.</p>

				<p>	Bonsai comes from two Chinese words that quite literally mean 
				"tray grow," or potted tree.  The Chinese claim the origination of 
				the practice, but it was the Japanese who really laid seige to the 
				concept and turned it into their own, even adopting the same word 
				into their language.  The Japanese hold bonsai such a high art 
				because rather than feeling nature to be diminished by 
				miniaturization, they consider it much more intensified, a 
				crystalization process that holds within it the grace and beauty and 
				mystery of life itself.</p>

				<p>	Bonsai is a very formal art in Japan, with strict rules and 
				specially defined shapes each with their own name.  "The Japanese are 
				so stylish with bonsai," says Bob Furnback, founding President of the 
				Deep Cut Bonsai Society in Middletown, New Jersey.  "They've been 
				doing it for 800 years.  We're sort of developing our own American 
				style, following the basic rules of the Japanese."  Besides the 
				general leeway in adapting rules, the essential difference between 
				Japanese bonsai and Western versions, says Furnback, are in the 
				plants available as subjects.  He and his wife Jean are strong 
				proponents of using native New Jersey trees in their own bonsai 
				creations, and a good percentage of the trees they have used in their 
				sixty-odd bonsai collection have been seedlings or dwarfed trees 
				found right here in the state, then trained to both shape and size.</p>
